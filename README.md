# Cryptography Tool – Caesar Cipher & ROT13

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Python-based** cryptography tool that uses **shift ciphers** to encrypt and decrypt text.  
It supports:  
- **Caesar Cipher** – Shifts characters by a specified number of positions.  
- **ROT13** – A special case of the Caesar Cipher that shifts characters by exactly 13 positions.

## 🔑 How It Works
- **Caesar Cipher Example** (shift of 3):  
  `"HELLO WORLD"` → `"KHOOR ZRUOG"`  
- **ROT13 Example**:  
  `"HELLO WORLD"` → `"URYYB JBEYQ"`  

Both ciphers work by substituting each letter with another, making it harder for unauthorized individuals to decipher the original message.

## ✨ Features
- Written in **Python** 🐍  
- Encrypt and decrypt using any Caesar shift value  
- Automatic ROT13 encryption/decryption  
- Lightweight and easy to use

## ▶️ Usage
1. Choose the cipher (Caesar or ROT13)  
2. Enter your text  
3. Get the encrypted or decrypted result instantly

## 📂 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
